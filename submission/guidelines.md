# CHAOSS Badging Project submission guidelines

## General Guidelines
- Make sure all the [requirements](./requirements.md) are fulfilled before initiating a CHAOSS Badging application.
- Timely integrate reviewers' feedback and update details while your CHAOSS Badging application is being evaluated.

## Application guide

1. Create a fork of [project-diversity-and-inclusion](https://github.com/badging/project-diversity-and-inclusion) repository
2. Append an entry to the table in the README in a separate branch
3. Create a PR to project-diversity-and-inclusion `master` branch to add your proposed changes
4. Fill out the PR template with required details
5. The application process starts when PR is opened
6. Communicate with the reviewers during the process and update your project based on their feedback
7. The review ends when either:
    - All required metric checks are satisfied
    - No more feedback can be put into action
   
   When either of these conditions are met, the moderator suggests the approprite badge for the project through a PR suggestion.
   This suggestion can be applied directly in the form of a commit.
8. The whole process ends when the PR with the Badge is added to the master branch.
